5:First let us start wifi-pumpkin using sudo command 

10:We can see that session started with specific id now to see the available access points we 
need to use ap command Here we can see the SSID, Securtiytype, name and channel

21:Now we need to configure the network interface i took it as wlan0 
Once the interface has been set we need to set the name of access point that will be created
 

38:Now we need to set noproxy plugin and to check whether it is set or not 
46:we need to give proxies command Here we can see the available proxies

55:Next step is to ignore all log from pydns_server
1.3:Now to check the processes done we can use ap command
here we can see that name of ssid changed from jiowifi to freewifi

1.16:Next we need to set the security code for the ssid
to set password we need to set security true 

1.27:and here we can see security type has been 
changed and the a default preshared key has been showed



1.37:to change the security key we need to use the following command 
1.53:Here we can see that the shared key has been changed



2.02:As this should be public network i am removing the password
2.10: We can see that there is no password set. 

2.18:Now lets's start 

2.21:Once the device gets connected to this wifi we will get access to the device 
that is connected and the information like mac address of device and websites 
he/she searched.

So that's all about the demo
Thank you
