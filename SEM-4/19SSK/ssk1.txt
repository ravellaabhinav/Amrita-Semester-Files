Despite having such unique advantages, social media is considered to be one of the most harmful elements of society. If the use of social media is not monitored, it can lead to grave consequences.

It is harmful because it invades your privacy like never before. The oversharing happening on social media makes children a target for predators and hackers.Thus, the sharing on social media especially by children must be monitored at all times.

1.Fake and incorrect information sharing – Social networking sites can create panic when fake and wrong information is shared   upon them. Some people might use these busy virtual platforms to create panic and tension.

2.Innocent people fall easy prey of false schemes – Many times, the fake companies or people can attract some innocent or   inexperienced users towards false schemes. Hence, social networking sites should be used carefully.

3.Misuse of Freedom – The freedom of expression on social networking sites can be misused by many unwanted elements in the form   of prank and harmful jokes, bullying, invasion on users’ privacy, etc.

4.Increased communication gap – Another disadvantage of social networking sites is that they are indirectly responsible for   continuously increasing communication gap among family members. Be it teens or adults; everyone is so busy in these social   sites chatting that they hardly find time to communicate with each other.
