        "* **Null hypothesis:** Null hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis that assumes that the observation is due to a chance factor.  Null hypothesis is denoted by; H0: μ1 = μ2, which shows that there is no difference between the two population means.\n",

        "* **Alternative hypothesis:** Contrary to the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis shows that observations are the result of a real effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Level of significance:** Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null-hypothesis.  100% accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis, so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Type I error:** When we reject the null hypothesis, although that hypothesis was true.  Type I error is denoted by alpha.  In hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the critical region is called the alpha region.\n",

        "* **Type II errors:** When we accept the null hypothesis but it is false.  Type II errors are denoted by beta.  In Hypothesis testing, the normal curve that shows the acceptance region is called the beta region.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Power:** Usually known as the probability of correctly accepting the null hypothesis.  1-beta is called power of the analysis.\n",
